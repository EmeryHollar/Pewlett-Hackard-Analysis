# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using SQL to analyze HR data
# Overview
Pewlett-Hackard has an alarming number of employees who will be retiring in the near future, so our task is to use SQL to create tables that identifies the number of retiring employees per title and additionally find the employees who can participate in a mentorship program.  Creating these tables will help the management of Pewlett-Hackard be more prepared for the impending wave of employees who will soon retire and help them create a plan to know who to hire in the coming months. 


# Results
-	As shown here  in the unique_titles table,![Unique_titles_row_count](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/165576594-57eb752a-aa4b-4db2-92ed-245b6f9a0d6d.png)
 there are 72,458 employees who are currently eligible for retirement.  This is an extremely high number, and something that management needs to be aware of from our analysis. 

-	In the image shown here,  ![retiring_titles_table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/165576567-15b82047-05c2-4398-a0e3-e691843846af.png)
 you can see the employee count per department of the employees who are currently eligible for retirement. The Senior Engineers and the general Senior Staff have by far the most employees eligible for retirement as seen by the count of 25,916 and 24,926 respectively. Pewlett-Hackard needs to invest heavily in the training for Engineers to promote within to some Senior Engineering roles. 

-	There is a staggering difference in the number of employees eligible for retirement and the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program. There needs to be strong internal discussions at Pewlett-Hackard about how to transition out of the “silver tsunami” whether that is hiring a drastic amount of outside employment or by offering some of the soon to be retired employees extra packages in order to stay on and lead the transition over the next few months. 


-	In terms of the mentorship eligibility of current employees, we see in the table shown here ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/165576479-d47adc06-984e-4a75-a56f-24edb2147fd8.png)
  that there are currently 1,549 employees eligible. This number is lower than what we would hope for given the number of retiring employees is much greater than this, so we should suggest putting more resources into hiring outside employees who are already qualified for Senior positions on top of promoting within.
